# Universe Database Project

This is my first project for the Relational Database Certification from freeCodeCamp.

I worked inside a Virtual Machine (VM) environment provided by GitHub, which was set up by freeCodeCamp. The environment included VS Code and PostgreSQL installed. All work was done through the terminal within VS Code.

I created the database and wrote SQL commands to build and populate tables for galaxies, stars, planets, and moons, including keys, constraints, and realistic data.

Through this project, I learned how to design a relational database schema, use various SQL data types (INT, NUMERIC, TEXT, BOOLEAN), and establish foreign key relationships between tables. I also practiced exporting the database into a dump file for backup and submission.

This project helped me solidify my practical skills with PostgreSQL and command-line tools in a real development environment.
